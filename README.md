# OpenProject Timesheet Plugin

This plugin adds a vue app for managing your personal time trackig on a handy weekly schedule.

## Structure

The ruby part of this app is just a wrapper putting in the vue assets into openproject context.
All the intresting stuff happens in `frontend/`

## Build

For easier deployment the built assets are stored here in this repository (although it's not the most elegant solution).

After changes the project has to be rebuilt with `npm run build`.
